        <p>Uncharted: The Lost Legacy is a 2017 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony
            Interactive Entertainment, serving as a standalone expansion to Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. Players control
            Chloe Frazer, who seeks the Tusk of Ganesh in the Western Ghats mountain ranges of India, with the help of
            ex-mercenary Nadine Ross, and prevent a ruthless warlord and his army of insurgents from igniting a civil
            war in the country. It is the first Uncharted game not to feature series protagonist Nathan Drake. Like
            other Uncharted games, The Lost Legacy is played from a third-person perspective; players use firearms and
            can use melee combat and stealth to defend against enemies. Players solve puzzles, incorporating several
            platformer elements to advance the narrative, and navigate the game world on foot or by vehicle.

            Development of The Lost Legacy began soon after the release of A Thief's End in May 2016. It builds upon
            gameplay elements established in previous Uncharted titles with its more open-ended gameplay. Chloe, a
            supporting character who appeared in previous Uncharted games as a friend, love interest, and associate to
            Nathan Drake, is the focus of the game, with the story, design, and gameplay elements reflecting her
            character. Claudia Black, Laura Bailey and Troy Baker reprised their roles as Chloe, Nadine and Sam
            respectively, through voice and motion capture, and assisted writer Josh Scherr and creative director Shaun
            Escayg with the development of the characters and story.

            The Lost Legacy was released for PlayStation 4 in August 2017; a remastered version was released for
            PlayStation 5 in January 2022, and for Windows in October 2022. The game received generally favorable
            reviews.</p>
